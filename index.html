      <h2>What is Very Dumb Ideas ?</h2>
      <br />
      Once upon a time, there were two inventors who had been friends since
      childhood and were passionate about crazy ideas. <br />One day, their path
      crossed with an amazing character. He was very intrigued by their
      creativity. <br />Fascinated, he vouched for his two companions and
      financed their project. From this fortuitous meeting, "Very Dumb Ideas"
      was born!
